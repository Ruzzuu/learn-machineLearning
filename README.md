Summarize what I read from pages 1 to 7. I learned what machine learning is. Machine learning is when a computer learns how to solve problems on its own, without us having to manually create a program step by step.


We can combine many approaches in machine learning, such as supervised learning (where the model is trained by humans), online learning (where the model learns incrementally in real time), and instance-based vs. model-based learning (comparing data with other data or building general models). These approaches are not exclusive—meaning we don’t have to use only one method at a time.


The purposes of machine learning include gaining insights from complex problems, solving problems that are difficult or impossible to solve with traditional methods, simplifying code, and improving performance.

Essential Terminology
- Training Set and Instances: The examples a system uses to learn are called the training set. Each example is a training instance (or sample).
- Predictors and Labels: In regression, the input features (e.g., mileage, age) used to make predictions are called predictors, and the predicted value (e.g., price) is the label

different of Attribute between Feature: An attribute is a data type (e.g., "Mileage"), while a feature generally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., "Mileage = 15,000")

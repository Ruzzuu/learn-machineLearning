Summarize what I read from pages 1 to 7. I learned what machine learning is. Machine learning is when a computer learns how to solve problems on its own, without us having to manually create a program step by step.


We can combine many approaches in machine learning, such as supervised learning (where the model is trained by humans), online learning (where the model learns incrementally in real time), and instance-based vs. model-based learning (comparing data with other data or building general models). These approaches are not exclusive—meaning we don’t have to use only one method at a time.


The purposes of machine learning include gaining insights from complex problems, solving problems that are difficult or impossible to solve with traditional methods, simplifying code, and improving performance.

Essential Terminology
- Training Set and Instances: The examples a system uses to learn are called the training set. Each example is a training instance (or sample).
- Predictors and Labels: In regression, the input features (e.g., mileage, age) used to make predictions are called predictors, and the predicted value (e.g., price) is the label

different of Attribute between Feature: An attribute is a data type (e.g., "Mileage"), while a feature generally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., "Mileage = 15,000")

i just get a new insgiht that write bahwa dimensior your database if you want get good on model using dimensionality reduction algoritm before we feed to another machine learning model

and a simple different of machine learning and deep learning is if machine learning is the problem is quite simple and it can solve using ramndom forest, esemble methods, and deep learning is best suit for more complex problem such as image recognition, speech recognition, etc..

and i have learning two model thats called supervised learning and unsupervised learning

### Supervised and unsupervised

supervised learning is classified method that his data has labeled before and for unsupervised learnig is the opposite from supervised learning

example of supervised learning are: linear regression, logistic regression, SVM's, decission trees and random forest and the example of this algoritm function is to handle any spam email

example of unsupervised learning are: k means, DBSCAN, hierarcy clustering, one class SVM, objective forest etc.. and the example of this algoritm function is to handle any fraud things

### Semisupervised learning

this model combine to algoritm semi and unsupervised learning that will handle unlabeled and labeled data. We can use this model implemented like on google photos that can recognize face and then labeled sometimes different people can labelen to one people

### Reinforcement learning

this model work like an agent he can learning from a wrong data and will analyze when that data will work and no like get a reward a pinalty from his fault 

### batch and online learning

in batch system learning incrementally, the workflow like this system learn from data available and then get a new data that we can called a good data, and then we dont use the old data, will continue work like this in the future. we can asume it like this training, evaluating, and launching. this model can be not good for a huge dataset and for data that have to update every hour it will give a high cost to doing his task the example is like for trading

in online learning the data will train and system will give an evalution is this data good or bad before launch and learn. it is good for trading dataset cause this model evaluate first and when have a new datasets just involving evaluate system until have a good data.The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data
